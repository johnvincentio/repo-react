/*
Create the action creators for a version of this Hot and Cold guessing game.
In the game, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100,
and the player then tries to guess the number.
The player gets feedback for each guess â€“
"hot" if their guess was close, and
"cold" if their guess was far.
When the user guesses the secret number, the app lets them know,
and they'll have the option to start a new game.
